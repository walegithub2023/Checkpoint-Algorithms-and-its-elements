# NAME OF REPOSITORY: Checkpoint-Algorithms-and-its-elements
# DESCRIPTION: A repository for Checkpoint Algorithms and its elements@ gomycode. This repo houses an algorithm which is described below.


# ALGORITHM NAME: read_a_sentence

# An Algorithm to read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

  - The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
  - The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
  - The number of vowels in the sentence.

# Below is a discription of what the alorithm is doing(algorithm steps to solve the problem):
  
  - Declaration and intialization of the 3 main variables to be used as counters.
  - Declaration and intialization of other variables.
  - Get input of sentence.
  - Check if character is a space then count the spaces with the loop.
  - Check if character is a vowel then count.
  - Add one to the space to get the number of words.
  - Add the point to the number of characters.
  - print number of characters, words and vowels.
